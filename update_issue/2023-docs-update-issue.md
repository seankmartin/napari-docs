# Reorganising and Improving Plugin Documentation

## ðŸ“š New content request

Hello everyone!

The napari plugin ecosystem and the content at [napari.org/plugins](https://napari.org/dev/plugins) have been growing rapidly, and it would be beneficial to reorganize the plugin documentation to improve navigation. Here is a proposal for restructuring the existing plugin-related content and introducing new valuable information. Please add any suggestions or comments on this - I'd love to hear your thoughts!

### Mock-up of the plugins main page

Here is a mock-up of the proposed site layout at a top level:

### How this proposal was developed

The proposed reorganisation and new pages have tried to follow the ideas from the [DiÃ¡taxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), splitting documentation into Tutorials (step by step lessons or learning experiences), How-to guides (directions to solve specific problems), Explanations (understanding oriented discussions), and Reference (information-oriented technical descriptions) pages.
The layout draws inspiration from the documentation of other open source projects with plugin or extension capabilities, napari plugin related content in external sites, and the recent updates to the [napari.org](https://napari.org) site to use grid layouts on index pages.
This layout aims to achieve two main objectives:

#### Aim 1: align documentation with user/developer flow

</p></details>

---

The goal is to divide the documentation into pages that cater to either users or developers.
We assume that plugin users want to discover, install, and effectively utilise plugins to solve their problems.
On the other hand, plugin developers want to build and maintain plugins to support the users.
The documentation should align with the typical flow for both users and developers, considering that these groups are not mutually exclusive.
Additionally, this division between users and developers can also help describe when a user might consider becoming a plugin developer, how to do so, and what makes a great plugin.
For example, this information would be useful if a user wants to share their napari script or widget with others or contribute to an existing plugin.

#### Aim 2: centralise plugin information

Currently, there is a wealth of information for plugin users and developers, but it is somewhat scattered.
The goal is to centralise this information on the plugins site.
Importantly, the aim is not to duplicate content on [napari.org](https://napari.org) but to provide short summaries and cross-link to the relevant main information page.
At the end of this issue, you'll find a non-exhaustive table which lists many of the current resources that are available for plugin developers and users.

### The location of napari hub related documentation

The proposal includes incorporating some [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org/) related documentation on the napari site.
This is in an effort to encapsulate information in one highly discoverable documentation area, benefiting both the typical user journey, which often involves finding plugins on the napari hub, and the typical developer journey, which usually ends with publishing their package to PyPI and the napari hub.
By placing napari hub related information on the napari site, it may make it clearer how to use the built in napari functionality (such as the plugin installer menu) in conjunction with or separately from the napari hub.
Additionally, it will help clarify the usage of plugin metadata by napari itself, its usage by the napari hub, and the overlap between them.

However, very good cases can also be made for keeping [napari.org/plugins](https://napari.org/plugins) completely separate from hub related information.
In this case, perhaps that information could be placed on the napari hub and cross linked to from this documentation.

### Implementation

The implementation of this proposal would involve:

1. A reorganisation of the existing plugin documentation into the new structure.
2. The creation of new documentation pages.

This process would likely occur in stages.
The reorganisation of the existing documentation would be prioritised, allowing it to be available in the new structure as soon as possible.
The consolidation of existing information would follow, and new pages would be created as time permits.

### Related issues

There is one main open issue with some overall suggestions on how to structure and add to the plugin developer information (as opposed to a specific page change, for e.g.), which could be integrated as part of this effort <https://github.com/napari/docs/issues/25>.
However, there are also many open issues related to specific changes to certain pages.
These issues are not listed here to maintain focused on the overall structural improvements.

### Resources for documentation

Here is a non-exhaustive list of resources that are currently available for plugin developers and users.
These resources could all be valuable in the creation of the new plugin documentation.
